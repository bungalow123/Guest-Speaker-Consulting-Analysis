 learned about marketing and how to optimize marketing across different channels Product and
 the effect on user acquisition of offering 2 free episodes before a paywall and Content and what
 program to acquire We learned about end to end data projects that go from project kickoff
 data source validation  data analytics  collect insights  report out Lastly he gave us
 different career paths we could go down and skills needed for each one The part about
 interviews were useful as I know what type of SQL interviews to prepare me for",Sweetnam,1,110,0,1,0,0
2,I have learned a lot from Mr Sweetnams talk It is very interesting to get to know the daytoday work of a data scientist and see how they apply statistical knowledge to real world projects Below are some points that I learned I learned about data analytics in the entertainment industry There are many aspects where data science can be applied including marketing product and content More specifically his role at Retention  Engagement Analytics involves project management for analytics databases KPI dashboards and reporting promo analysis and recommendation I also learned about the process of data projects from end to end It starts with the project kickoff and then data source validation data analysis and ends with collecting insights and report 80 of the time is spent in data cleaning and 20 of the time is running algorithms I learned more about the different types of data scientistsanalystsdeveloper roles and their skills including soft skills communication enthusiasm willingness to learn and domain knowledge and technical skills SQL R Python visualization platform and statistics We should aim to have a T profile set of skills be an expert in one category and just know enough of the rest to be dangerous His advice is useful Communication skills are really important We should improve our skills of explaining complicated things to nontechnical people Asking the right questions is also important,Sweetnam,1,229,0,1,0,0
3,From MrSweetnams talk I learnt how life would be like after I graduate from college and working for a company In order to be wellprepared for job in the future I need to learn not only R but also python SQL and any other software that can help me to success Moreover it is very important to work in a field that I am interested in becuase working in such a field I will be more passionate,Sweetnam,0,77,0,1,0,0
4,I enjoyed the speech MrSweentam gave us on Tuesday He clearly told us what data analyst looks after college What he amazed me was that he visually demonstrated what potential job could be for Stats Major According to a table on a slide I am kinda interested in doing Data research in the future because I just hit its requirement SQLRPythonSparkTensorflow In this quarter I got my first ever research in UCLA using Tensorflow to study convolutional neural network Also in his talk he gave us a graph of how he makes distribution of daily time spent When I was trying to look into that I could ima,Sweetnam,1,108,0,0.784,0.216,0.5106
5,Mr Sweetnams talk is about the statistics after college From his own experience he introduced how data and analytics used at an entertainment company Marketing Product and Content are three important aspects As for his role at NBCUniversal he is doing central data and analytics consulting on projects across the businesses like universal studio film and news Besides he is also working on decision science about retention and engagement analytics Going through his work I learn a lot about what I can do after college Whats more he also showed us his distribution of daily time spent which give me an overview of working time One important thing in the distribution is to learn new tech Although we have learned a lot of stuff in college we still need to learn new tech daily,Sweetnam,1,134,0,1,0,0
6,"Quinn Sweetnams talk was very insightful about the data science in the industry removed away
 from academia I found the term data creative to be very inspiring because of my creative
 background as an artist Much like how as a musician and composer I try to communicate
 between the audience and my band in order to create a dynamic experience It is my job as
 band leader to provide stimulating music for my band to play while also being digestible by the
 audience This is similar to my interest in being able to communicate effectively between the
 business and technical side of my future data related career
 I also appreciated Quinns positive outlook towards the company culture where business
 management is understanding of peoples different repertoire of technical skills It was great
 that he touched upon imposter syndrome too because I know that is something that my cohort
 and I suffer from",Sweetnam,1,152,0,1,0,0
7,"Mr Sweetnam has been the most relevant guest speaker so far because it hasnt been
 long since hes been in our shoes As Im applying for jobs I find it difficult to market myself
 without much experience or knowledge I learnt that companies dont expect you to know much
 coming out of a university Of course basic statistical background knowledge is expected but
 we dont have to be experts at modeling and analysis I learnt that the majority of time is spent
 preparing and cleaning data as he mentioned in the 8020 rule This makes me feel better and
 more confident as I continue to apply for jobs because I now know that Im not alone in feeling
 inadequate My takeaway is to brush up on the fundamentals and practice more applied
 problems I will also try to emphasize my soft skills in communications and teamwork and use
 my prior serving experiences to leverage this point",Sweetnam,1,156,0,1,0,0
8,"I learned that there are different types of job in the field of data science like data analyst data
 engineer data product manager data creative as well as the business side of data An
 important skill set required for the more technical roles is SQL SQL is an important tool to help
 you work with data and analyze it better However a skill that spreads across all roles is
 communication skills We need to learn how to communicate effectively and help both STEM
 and nonSTEM team members understand your data and your findings",Sweetnam,0,93,0,1,0,0
9,"There are so many questions that a company can ask for a statistician to answer For
 example How can you structure our website to optimize customer conversions on the checkout page You also would typically spend 80 of the time understanding the question and cleaning the data compared to only 20 on answering the question In terms of soft skills communication is the most important In terms of technical skills SQL is the most important The last good piece of advice is that often employers would list off so many skills for the job because they do not know what exactly the job entails Therefore you do not necessarily need to meet everything on the checklist",Sweetnam,0,116,0,1,0,0
10,Mr Sweetnam described the main purposes of his job and talked about a future project being released in the summer He works for Universal and Peacock His new project is an online streaming service that provides a wide range of tv series and movies such as the Jurassic Park franchise and Parks and Rec He broke down his time management and how it reflected the 8020 rule Sweetnam said that most of our time should be spent exploring and cleaning the data and the remainder of the time is gathering all of the findings It is great to see the different job opportunities that can be possible after college and how statistics ties into the work,Sweetnam,1,116,0,1,0,0
11,"I learned a great deal from Mr Sweetnams talk I enjoyed hearing about the steps that Mr
 Sweetnam and his team at NBC take when working on a project The importance of presenting
 results that are actionable stood out to me as even though this may seem obvious from a
 business perspective it is not something we always focus on in our statistics courses In addition I thought it was interesting to hear about the different types of roles in industry that individuals working in data can have from a more business focused role to a stronger researcher or developer focused role I was aware that the terms data analyst and data scientist can vary greatly from one company to another but I had never seen the different data roles explained so clearly This discussion definitely helped to clarify industry data roles in my mind Finally it was great to hear the importance of communication in the workplace reiterated This is something I definitely found vital during my internship this past summer so it was nice to hear again",Sweetnam,0,180,0,0.745,0.255,0.6249
12,"From Mr Sweetnams talk I learned that communication is very important because the main
 point of analysis is to answer a problem and its difficult to do that well without good
 communication skills I also learned about the 8020 rule which means people usually spend
 80 of their time doing exploratory analysis data cleaning and the last 20 is the modeling",Sweetnam,0,61,0,1,0,0
13,What I learn from Mr Swettenhams talk is that the how the data and analytics used at an entertainment company On marketing we can optimize the marketing across different channel and think of how to group the programs together On product we can structure the website to optimize customer conversation to check out pages For content what type of movies or shows that customers are interested In order to be a great in a team you need to spend great deal of time on coding and questioning,Sweetnam,1,87,0,1,0,0
14,Mr Sweetnams talk was very informational and clear I learned a lot about the day to day life of a data analyst I also have an overview about the skill set of a data analyst I also become more clear about the difference roles in data science such as data engineer data analyst data scientist etc I learned the importance of SQL and become more confident about my skills that I dont need to be perfect in every single language I am glad that I choose to major in statistics and launch a career in data science,Sweetnam,0,97,0,1,0,0
15,I think this presentation is really useful for me I am considering about business analytic for my graduate program Specially the graph of comparing difference between business analyst data engineer and data scientist I also learned that for data business people the technical skill is excel and SQL For business analyst its focuses more on organization business problem comfortable with data and concept This gives me a lot of useful information,Sweetnam,0,71,0,0.775,0.225,0.4927
16,The speaking of Mr Sweetnam introduced that how is the data and analytics used in various aspects talked about what a role that data science plays in a enterprise and that data science do made great progress in hightech enterprises I guess it is where the explosive growth of data the fastest which give me a sense that the application of data science is needed everywhere in a way He also breaks it down into details such as what do we do when we doing the data analyzing let me get familiar to this aspect and have a clearer idea of future learning and planning which is super helpful for me as a senior whos looking for a formal job,Sweetnam,1,120,0,1,0,0
17,His talk was really interesting I like the way he explained the role data scientist and the essential skills that we would need I remember he combined the soft and technical skills for example communication skills with SQL willingness to learn with visualization platformTableau and domain knowledge with statistics I think that is a really helpful information And he also talked about the four proposed profiles of data professions and their technical skill set potential job title and the descriptions those were really helpful Overall that was a really nice presentation because he gave a lot of useful information but not just the big picture of that role I really like his presentation,Sweetnam,0,113,0,0.656,0.344,0.6976

19,"I think the most important things I learned from Mr Sweetnams talk is the differentiation between datarelated job positions Previously I have only had very vague perceptions of the dataoriented roles based on my knowledge The tables and charts and MrSweetnan provides to distinguish different types of jobs are very useful They consist of the specific functions of these job positions and the required specialized skills accordingly 
 
 Personally I think my previous trainings and experiences best align with the role of data creative I have applied for multiple Business AnalyticsData Science master programs and since I havent only had limited internship working in the industry my business knowledge is insufficient This makes me fall into the category of a data analyst data creative who works to conduct exploratory analysis and modeling Also I have reinforced my decision not to pursue a career as a data engineer or a researcher at my current stage as the specialized knowledge required for these positions do not quite fit my own",Sweetnam,1,169,0,0.84,0.16,0.2716

21,"There were a lot of things that I was able to take away from Mr Sweetnams Lecture
 however the one thing that stuck with me the most was that he said that it is better to pick
 your passion and to be a master at it rather than to try to spread yourself too thin and learn
 every single thing in the industry I liked that he was very clear in describing both his past experience with NBCUniversal and
 what the roles required It was interesting that he mentioned that part of his job is not just analyzing data but also
 deciding how to capture the data what data is important to capture and how to store the
 data This was something that I had not thought about when it comes to a role as a Data
 Scientist Being given the freedom and responsibility to not only work with an analyze
 industry data but being a deciding role on what will give you the results you are looking for
 goes even deeper It really stood out to me when he said that the most common models he will create are
 logistic regression models This goes back to what I learned in STATS 101C and has been
 reiterated in this class  that oftentimes the best model is the simplest one and it will be the
 one that is best received by a client because it will be the easiest to understand and get the
 job done as opposed to high level neural networks Additionally I really appreciated that he explained the flow of his work  starting off with a
 goal and coming to a clear research question then data source validation where
 communication is a big part followed by the actual work in data analysis and collecting
 insights and asking questions then finally having a deliverable at the end to report Something that will stick with me from this speech was that he said it is easy to get too deep
 into the data and go on tangents and start looking into the data and getting off track You
 want to make sure you are always answering the question and with everything you do to go
 back and see if it is helping you find a solution the client is asking for Finally I learned that it is ok to not be an expert at everything SQL Python Tableau R right
 when you get out of college but you should definitely have familiarity with all of those
 concepts and for me at UCLA R is obviously my strongest suit because that is what we are
 taught and use most When it comes to interviews it was comforting to hear that with SQL
 and other things you should know the basics of a left join and group by which are all things
 that can be picked up very quickly especially if you have a willingness to learn",Sweetnam,1,487,0,1,0,0
22,I found Quinns talk to be very engaging and interesting I always here about how undergraduates want to become data scientists but I never really know what that job entailed so it was great to hear Quinn talk specifically about his projects and daytoday activities As someone who isnt pursuing data science after graduation it definitely intrigued me and is something I would consider further down the line I also found it interesting how Quinn mentioned there are many different roles within data science and you dont necessarily have to be an expert in every facet of data science I personally am not that strong in programming so it was good to hear how there are many roles within data science that do not focus heavily on programming but are roles where I can apply my other strengths to,Sweetnam,1,139,0,0.828,0.172,0.4005
23,I found Quinns presentation to be exceptionally helpful for an aspiring professional It was helpful to learn about how he spends his day  5050 on coding vs generating insights I think it will be pertinent to my future career in consulting especially as it pertains to balancing my workday Furthermore his segmentation of datarelated careers into data businesspersons data creatives data researchers and data engineers made the industry seem a lot more accessible from the standpoint of a soontobe graduate Even if one does not have a huge expertise in mathematics or coding you can still enter the data business and make an impact through more product management and business related positions Overall I was really engaged by Quinns talk and would honestly have loved to hear it earlier in my degree before I had secured a job It definitely made me feel inspired to pursue a career more related to statistics,Sweetnam,1,153,0,1,0,0
24,Mr Sweetnam provided insight about how data science is applied in industry particularly in entertainment It is refreshing to view the realm of statistics from the applied perspective and I was especially amazed by the fact that data analysts typically use only 30 of their time writing code They spend plenty of their time brainstorming data insights producing visualizations communicating with stakeholders and learning new technologies Our domain knowledge will serve as tools and the main objective of us as data analysts or scientists is producing value for business whether it is about customer segmentation user research or content selection,Sweetnam,1,100,0,1,0,0
25,From Mr Sweetnams talk I learned that a data analyst can work within a conglomerate on a projectbased system as well as across different aspects of the business I also knew that many firms might have different definitions and functions for the same positions such as business analyst or data scientist However although there might be difference in the functions of different positions many skills are required in these positions such as communications skills and command of SQL,Sweetnam,0,78,0,1,0,0
26,"I feel like I learned the most about what I wanted to know from this talk when compared
 to the other guest speakers we have had Mr Sweetnam is a UCLA 18 graduate who works as
 a Senior Analyst  Retention  Engagement Analytics Decision Sciences at Peacock part of
 NBCUniversal He used to work on the Enterprise Business Intelligence team but now works for
 Decision Sciences where he works with retention and engagement analytics One of his case
 studies involved seeing what drives loyalty on the website and identifying distinct segments of
 visitors He explained that most of the time spent working on a project is focused on the data
 source validation and data analysis He also gave us different soft and technical skills that we
 should know as aspiring analysts the most important of which is communication and being able
 to communicate technical ideas to a nontechnical audience Overall I really enjoyed Mr

28,"On February 5th our Stats 141SL class had a guest speaker Quinn Sweetnam a senior
 data engineer from NBC universal As a former UCLA statistic student Quinn shared a lot of
 insights and experience about his career choice and gave us a lot of advice for our future
 I found Quinns talk really helpful because of his easygoing attitude and the closeness between
 us since he was one of us in the same classroom taking the same class a couple of years ago His
 experience also gave us a lot of confidence that we could survive do well and one day become
 as professional as Quinn is 
 
 The most interesting topic Mr Sweetnam brought is how the data and analytics are used
 at an entertainment company Quinn emphasized on two different directions Marketing and
 Product management For the marketing group data could give an idea about how should people
 optimize the marketing strategy across different channels and what groups of programs should
 the manager market together For the product side Quinn gave us an example that data could tell
 whats the effect on user acquisition of offering 2 free episodes before a paywall on the app
 Overall it is an honor to hear from a former student of UCLA talking about his career",Sweetnam,1,215,0,1,0,0
29,Mr Sweetnam had a very informative and organized talk yesterday The one thing that I learned was how to solve a problem that arise or requested by clients There are five steps which are figuring out the question collecting data and cleaning data analyzing the data interpreting the data and the output and presenting to clients This can serve as a guide for me next time I need to solve a problem so I wont be lost when facing a new question He also talked about the skills that are important to different career paths that are possible for our statistics students and which are more important to specific career path This is very helpful because I now have a better understanding on what I should work on to get the job I want And plus I learned that knowing SQL is very important,Sweetnam,1,144,0,1,0,0

32,"I really enjoyed Quinn Sweetnams presentation to the class and learned a lot about how the job title Data
 Science is really an umbrella term used to describe a number of different roles pertaining to data When
 looking for a job Quinn stressed the importance of asking questions about the role because the listing of
 Data Scientist can mean a number of different things in todays world For example a company could list
 Data Scientist as the job title but they could be looking for a role as a Data Engineer Data Analyst Data
 Product Owner etc He also stressed the importance of both soft skills and hard skills and mentioned that
 you should be able to tell your mom what you are doing in class I found this advice useful because it is
 important to be able to take complex ideas and synthesis them into something anyone can understand I also
 learned the importance of not trying to learn everything Quinn stressed that we should become an expert in
 one skill and know enough of other skills to be dangerous The End to End Data Project visual was also
 useful to understand what a typical project outline looks like for Quinn I learned that around 50 of time
 is spent on code and the remaining 50 is typically spent turning insights into actions This aligns with
 what Quinn stressed about the soft skills being as important if not more important as the hard skills in his
 particular role Overall I gained a lot of insights about Quinns role at NBCUniversal and what has have
 helped him be successful as a recent UCLA graduate",Sweetnam,1,274,0,0.736,0.264,0.5563
33,"The most important thing I learned from this talk is the core skills of being a data analyst First for technical skills we need to be equipped with SQL RPython visualization platform and undoubtedly knowledge in statistics Also speaking of soft skills it is important for us to know how to communicate with others be passionate about our work and always be open to new knowledge
 Besides I also have a broad idea of how a case study was conducted at an entertainment company which is mostly like what we usually did in a statistics class data validation data analysis written report and visualization One thing is a little bit different is that we seldom do project kickoff in class because we are told what the right question is whereas in reality we need to figure it out by ourselves with our team members",Sweetnam,1,144,0,0.851,0.149,0.2716
34,"I genuinely believe that each talk we have had in this Stats 141SL class has been better than the last The learning curve from Quinns talk was definitely really high for me I appreciated how energetic passionate and knowledgeable Quinn was about the subject I think he really gained my attention as a speaker when he explained in a casestudy manner about his roles and duties as a Data Analyst for NBCUniversal My key takeaways were
 1 Data Analysis Has a Far Reaching Impact Quinn explained how data analysis intermingles with psychology and human behavior as he explained how he extracted data to point out customer trends while watching warrelated movies This led to his team suggesting showing 1917 movie advertisements before Private Ryan on NBCUs soontobelaunched streaming service Peacock
 2 Data Analysts Have a Wide Variety of Responsibilities Quinn mentioned that his role included doing project management for an analytics database I learned that the career progression for data analysts is steep as it comes with a lot of learning and growth opportunities From his talk I gauged that in the past 2 years he had been able to equip himself with soft skills like learning to lead a project team and hard skills such as database management and structure and storage of data which I thought was a role exclusively reserved for data engineers 
 3 Data Analysis as a Launchpad for Future Careers As Quinns role includes things like promo analyses and recommendations as well as creating churn and engagement models I feel like data analyst roles set up people for great success in their career paths I think Quinn is equipped now to pursue highpaying and prestigious roles in product management finance and marketingadvertising",Sweetnam,1,288,0,1,0,0

 advice to college students trying to break into the data science industry although he
 mentioned that the word data science encompasses many things and there are
 actually many different types of data scientists These are the things I found particularly
 helpful from his talk
 Firstly he talked about a day in the life of data analytics  50 of time spent
 around code which includes writing code troubleshooting learning new technologies
 and 50 spent on the report itself which includes compiling insights  visuals talking
 with stakeholders answering questions
 Secondly he discussed the core skills across roles in data science  soft skills
 which includes communication enthusiasm willingness to learn domain knowledge
 and technical skills which includes SQL  RPython visualization platform statistical
 knowledge
 Thirdly he delved into the individual roles in data science and what each one
 meant  advanced analyst data product owner data engineer data scientist and

 exactly what I would like to do in the future I liked how he talked about the different ways that
 NBCUniversal markets their products and how they can measure relationships based off of a
 consumers behavior He mentioned that it was important to be willing to learn which is
 something that Dr Kricorian said as well I also found this talk to be more relatable to me

 procedures data analysts go through in a media  entertainment company I was really fascinated
 by the fact that there are so many ways data can be used in business marketing Until I heard Mr Sweetnams talk I always thought that the result coming out from a data analysis is mostly just numbers that cannot hold meanings such as business marketing strategy
 After I thought about the viewers in NBC Universals perspective I realized that data of
 viewers can be segmented into so many criterias of business marketing strategies In fact just
 like what Mr Sweetnam told us data analysis can be used for not only just business marketing
 but also product and content I was very interested to know that data analysis can provide a
 specificprecise answer on questions such as What is the effect on user acquisition of offering 
 free episodes before a paywall on our app or How can I structure my website to optimize
 customer conversions on the checkout page
 
 The thing I learned other than the data analysis usage was the lesson on the importance
 of communication over the data analysis I remember Mr Sweetnam saying If you come to
 work and make a mistake on python or any coding then I can simply help you to get better
 however if you lack on the general knowledge of statistics and have a hard time having a
 communication with coworkersclients then that will be the case where you either wont be able to work for our company or will have a very hard time Until I heard this from Mr Sweetnam I always thought that the most important thing for data analyst jobs has to be coding Overall after hearing Mr Sweetnams talk I could completely agree that statistical job is more focused on the general background of statistics and not just coding used for the data analysis",Sweetnam,1,328,0,1,0,0

 positions I am most interested in Furthermore Mr Sweetnam mentioned the importance of
 communication which was interesting to hear because I did not expect this ability to be entirely
 indispensable in the recruiting process Finally I learned about all the different ways data
 analytics are incorporated into the work performed by the entertainment industry which was
 quite eye opening because I am very unfamiliar with this industry Overall I learned quite a bit

 introduced a very unique concept to me in using the term data analyzer I had seen many maps
 and tables similar to the one he showed regarding overlapping yet contrasting roles of
 dataadjacent people including data scientists engineers and analysts but I had never seen
 one with as much detail as his While I found his spider chart a bit confusing to read I really
 liked the tabulated form of the comparisons between the different analyzers and the skills and
 tools that certain roles need to hammer home harder than others His resonating point of not
 necessarily being a jack of as trades and thus becoming a master of none was quite poignant
 as it seemed to be very logical advice following his structured outline of the similarities and
 differences between different data analyzers",Sweetnam,1,149,0,0.745,0.255,0.6249
45,"we had a guest speaker Quinn Sweetnam Senior data engineer from NBC Universal a media and entertainment company Mr Sweetnam gave us a presentation about some of his considerations for aspiring analyzers
 
 First of all Quinn gave us some example of applications of data analytics at an entertainment
 company For marketing data can decide the market strategy for different channels and what
 groups of programs should go together For product side data analysis could tell the effect on
 user acquisition of offering 2 free episodes before a paywall on our app and how can I structure
 my website to optimize customer conversions on the checkout page For the content side
 statistics could give an insight about what program should I acquire for my streaming service
 given that we will have a program A and what
 types of contents resonate with different groups of viewers
 
 The most interesting thing Quinn talked about is his idea about skills that we should prepare us
 with Instead of lots of programming languages or technical skills soft skills in his opinion
 would be more important Skills such as communication enthusiasm controllable during the
 interview willingness to learn and domain knowledge would be of value when we go deep into
 industry Technical skills are also important and we should learn SQL RPython visualization
 platform Ie Tableau and statistics knowledge But as he said If a company wants you to
 know 100 programming language they are expecting a god The idea is its never too late to
 learn a language but soft skills require us to learn and practice in advance",Sweetnam,1,266,0,1,0,0
46,"DrSweetnam talked about different types of data professionals including data business people data creatives data developers and data researchers After listening to his talk now I know that technical skill sets are needed for each profession and therefore I have a better understanding about the future opportunities 
 Mr Sweetnams talk is really helpful to me As a student pursing position like data analyst I know the skills that are important but never know how we can learn or improve them or how skills are implemented in industries Mr Sweetnam shared his work experiences that gave us concrete ideas of how to improve ourselves He also pointed out an important point for data analyst position that communication is the most important thing And we should practice it more",Sweetnam,1,128,0,1,0,0

 Tips for Interview 
 If the interviewer gives a case it is probably something surrounding a problem theyve tried to solve or is currently solving
 
 A good data analyst acts like a translator taking a complex idea and explain it in a way that everyone can understand",Sweetnam,1,236,0.174,0.71,0.116,-0.2263
48,"Response to Mr Sweetnam
 1 SQL plays an essential role in the professional data science and it is important advanced SQl technical skills
 2 Data science has many applicable fields in the entertainment company such as marketing product and content
 3 It is important to figure out distinct segments of visitors to the website
 4 A data scientist should have both soft skills and technical skills During our academic study we pay much of attention to the technical skills In our future career the soft skill is also significant
 5 I found Sweetnams talk particularly interesting because he gave a lot of good advice and insight into what the near future could hold As someone who relates to the imposter syndrome that he mentioned it was reassuring to hear Sweetnam explain what most people are actually looking for in potential applicants It was also nice to hear that time spent at work in the data analyst field is spread fairly evenly between time in code and time interacting with people The resume advice he gave was also helpful",Sweetnam,1,178,0,0.857,0.143,0.25
49,"There were 3 main things I learned from Mr Sweetnams talk
 1 SQL is simply necessary for anyone who works with data today I already knew that SQL was important for most data scientists but I thought that only data engineers really needed to be experts in SQL however it seems that mastery of SQL is almost demanded for most datarelated jobs today I definitely need to brush up on my own SQL skills
 2 Individual work always builds on the work of others Mr Sweetnam constantly emphasized how he works as part of the team and even if they break off to do individual work for a while they always come back and see how their ideas fit together He also mentioned how he had a coworker who had done some analysis in his field before and he would essentially participate in a feedback loop with that coworker and bounce ideas off them This is something that I sometimes struggle to do especially if I want things done my way
 3 Communication is sometimes more important than technical skills This was a bit surprising to me since every jobinternship always lists the technical skills first and I assumed that communication would naturally assume second place in what makes candidates desirable It encouraged me to think about how I can work on my own presentation skills especially in explaining statistical concepts to a nonstatistical audience",Sweetnam,1,235,0,1,0,0
50,"I learned that some important skills that a data analyst should have include
 communication enthusiasm and a willingness to learn While I have seen communication emphasized as an essential soft skill in the workplace I did not realize just how much having enthusiasm for data and showing that you are willing to learn can impact an interviewers impression of you I also learned the importance of being able to create a visualization that properly expresses your analysis Additionally I learned about the slight differences between different data professions and how skills might differ between these professions which can help me when Im looking at job descriptions in my job search",Sweetnam,1,110,0,0.859,0.141,0.2023
51,"Interview recommend an answer with an action associated with it 
 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex It takes a touch of genius  and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
 Communication skill is harder to train for a company
 computers are useless They can only give you answers",Sweetnam,0,56,0,0.828,0.172,0.3612

53,"In Mr Sweetnams talk on Statistics After College on Wednesday I learnt about how Statistics is being used in the workplace Many of the Statistical methods that weve learnt in the classroom were mentioned during the presentation For example logistic regression is oftentime used in industry a modeling method can be easily explained to clients who have little Statistical background and the neural network model which has very robust predictive performance while having low interpretability One of the key soft skills mentioned by Mr Sweetnam was the ability to illustrate or explain the concepts and results of a method to the general clients This is extremely important since in the workplace we will work with people from different disciplines and people with their distinguished expertise it is crucial that we are capable of explaining the concepts that we well know of in a way that people in different disciplines can easily understand In short there is a large potential in the career
 development in Statistics and Data Science and since there are so many new concepts and techniques being created and developed we should keep learning them when going into the workplace",Sweetnam,0,192,0,1,0,0

 effect of offering free episodes before a paywall In addition to that he also talked about the
 important skills data analysts need to succeed He emphasized SQL as an important skill for data
 analysts since it is crucial for distributing data He also indicated python and R are important
 programming skills that could help boost with modeling and career success In summary Mr

 definitely help me to better understand what should I learn to get a better job in statistics field
 For example he mentioned that SQL skill is basic and important as a data analyst data
 scientist However UCLA statistics department do not provide courses related to SQL to
 students This means that I have to learn this skill outside school Also knowing data
 visualization skill such as knowing tableau is an important skill as a data worker He brought

67,Mr Sweetnams talk is very impressive I am very interested in how to use data and analytics in improving product at an entertainment company I think in order to structure the website to optimize customer conversions on the checkout page we can use AB Testing and AA Testing which will help us show the significance features on websites In order to testing the effect on user acquisition of offering 2 free episodes I think we can construct models by separating the users by different groups and see their different performances,Sweetnam,1,90,0,0.77,0.23,0.5563
68,From Mr Sweetnams talk I get to know more about the field in statistics as a data scientist He shared many useful knowledge and skills we need to prepared broke down branches in the field positions and capacities match to different group of students may fit in or interested to He also indicated that the idea of the importance of interpretation to audience in term of statistic is relevant After his talk I realized my weakness and have a goal to better prepare myself in the rest of my senior year at UCLA And hopefully I could do better later when I start my career,Sweetnam,1,105,0,1,0,0
69,I have learned a lot from the Dr Andersons talk It is particularly interesting to see a real project that arises from the health care industry which we are unfamiliar with and see how people come up with research questions and find the appropriate methods Below are some points that I learned I learned a lot about baby cry I didnt know that baby cry can be different for different reasons From the talk I learned about how pain fussy and hungry will result in different baby cry and how we can detect the differences use Fourier transform to look at the intensity of different frequencies spectrogram and create high order acoustic features from the audios I also learned that infants who have stroke produce more slurred sounds By collecting data and train on them we can use baby cry as a biomarker for autism I learned about the process researchers do their research and in particular data collection and research question formalization It is interesting to see how they collected data through surveys on apps and webpages And with 1500200000 observations they come up with research questions What are new risk factors on gestational diabetes How substance abuse during a moms pregnancy affects the change in behavior in the baby And I was also able to see how these research questions get formulated into statistical analysis outcome and predictors It is interesting to see a project which we dont have domain knowledge about and how important it is for us to ask questions as a statistical consultant to better understand the dataset,Anderson,1,263,0,1,0,0
70,The most interesting part of the lecture for me was the subject matter To be honest I never really found medical data very interesting in general but exploring babys cries seems fascinating to me What also hit home was that Dr Andersons work was professional and high level and it followed the same structure that we have been learning this entire time Posing and understanding the research questions collecting data etc,Anderson,1,71,0,0.813,0.187,0.4576
71,In the research Dr Andersons idea of connecting babies crying sound and statistical data is very interesting She showed us some statistical results to support her idea and I learnt that if we can analyze babies sound by collect huge data set we would know what our babies are crying for In this case we will be able to let baby stop crying and offer them what they want,Anderson,1,69,0,1,0,0
72,I enjoyed this guests speech given by the DrAnderson She brought us a reallife example of how statistical analysis can help parents understand babies crying sound which is the coolest thing I have ever seen so far One thing I learned from her talk is that crying is one kind of communication between parents and their babies because different babies cries would give us different signals that babies want parents to do something for them According to plots of soundtrack statistical researchers can find there are some rule to explain the meaning of crying sound made from babies For example Neh sound means that the baby wants to let parents know they are hungry There are many fantastic topics about babys cries going on in DrAnderson I want to say thank you to her,Anderson,1,134,0,0.784,0.216,0.5106
73,Dr Andersons talk is about infant cry translator which is a very interesting and useful program There are problems for parents that they dont know what their babies crying for Are they painful fussy hungry or colic The tech tool introduced by Dr Anderson is to decipher infant cries so that we can know whats happening to the babies Dr Anderson have collected 500000 cries which is large enough to be compellent For parents what they need to do is only recording 5 seconds of the babys cry then chatterbaby would decipher the cry by machine learning and deep learning algorithms From my point of view chatterbaby is really applicable that can solve a lot of problems for parents,Anderson,1,119,0.205,0.795,0,-0.4767
74,It was very interesting to learn Dr Andersons current work on the baby monitoring app that was developed in conjunction with UCLA It was fascinating to find out how data such as survey information and audio data would be used by researchers I learned that the audio data would be processed by UCLA servers and then mapped to a pain level response variable to see if the baby was in distress I was not aware that there were differences in a babys cries depending on if they had a stroke or were autistic I also thought it was interesting how there were many things being inspected such as factors that are correlated to gestational diabetes,Anderson,1,115,0,0.813,0.187,0.4576
75,"Dr Anderson talked about how strokes affect speech in babies and adults Using auditory data of people experiencing a stroke she was able to analyze the trend and recognize how speech is impaired when the brain stem is under stress Just like how an adult would slur their words during a stroke babies too would slur their cries I think its amazing how statistics can help us understand babies better by analyzing what type of cries they make Babies cry all the time but its important to know which type of cries indicate a more severe problem I think Dr Andersons analysis of babies crying is the right direction in helping us understand why some babies cry for a prolonged period of time conic Her discussion about was very insightful and I now know that slurred speech is a common symptom of stroke Its something Ill definitely
 keep an eye out for",Anderson,1,152,0,1,0,0
76,In her lecture I learned about the project that she is currently working on and the application that she built The app she built analyzes the cries of a baby and determines the possible reasons why the baby is crying Her project focuses on analyzing two different hypotheses How substance abuse drugs and alcohol may affect the baby after in terms of autism And The risk of gestational diabetes I learned that you can create your own questions based on your own experiences such as how she created the ChatterBaby app partly because of her own experiences as a mother I learned a lot about this app such as what it does how the data was collected how the algorithms were made etc I feel as though the most important thing I learned was that you really need to ask your client about what the research question is Even after the great presentation we did not know the research question until we explicitly asked Dr Anderson herself To my surprise the questions deal with gestational diabetes and highrisk events to mothers and babies both things I would not have thought the research questions would be about after the whole presentation,Anderson,1,200,0,1,0,0
77,Dr Anderson created an app that records the cries of babies and lets the user know the reason behind the cry Also it served to collect data for gestational diabetes and how that is related to substance abuse by the mother It was interesting to see how different the cries can be For example when she showed us the cry of a baby with Criduchat syndrome it was obvious that it was different from the others It was very high pitched and very accurately resemble the cry of a cat Criduchat is due to part of a chromosome being missing and that causes the larynx to develop abnormally Another cry she showed us was one of a baby having a stroke Their wavelengths were much different They had many long pauses they were longer and the baby sounded like it was in distress,Anderson,1,143,0,0.867,0.133,0.25
78,Through Dr Andersons talk I learned about the ChatterBaby app and the overarching idea that a babys cry can predict why they are crying as well as reveal diseases or conditions the baby may have I also learned first hand the importance of listening closely to a client to understand what their goals are for their study In addition I saw how asking clarifying questions can help to make sure everyone is on the same page with these goals of the study Finally I enjoyed seeing the survey layout that the ChatterBaby team uses to collect data around the world I definitely related to this as I use REDCap to create surveys in a variety of languages to collect data at my job at the Department of Medicine Statistics Core It was great to see this skill set implemented in a new setting,Anderson,1,143,0,1,0,0
79,I thought it was really interesting to learn about the different cries that babies have Specifically the cri du chat cry of cat was very interesting and it was really clever for Dr Anderson to recognize the patterns of cries and develop a model to predict them and identify them,Anderson,1,50,0,0.8,0.2,0.4576
80,What I learn from Dr Anderson talk is that the data collection and app development is never easy The chatterbaby app is really good for the first mommy to take care of their babies especially for the firstbone They do not have any experience and seek for help,Anderson,0,48,0,1,0,0
81,I have known the app Chatter baby a long time ago back then I thought this app was really cool but never linked it with data analytics Dr Andersons talk was a very eye opening experience I learned the whole process of the development of a project Also how the dataset is expanded through user data collection I think the app is very helpful and with the huge amount of data collected it can expand its target to a wider range of baby activities,Anderson,1,84,0,1,0,0
82,Dr Andersons speaking is very good and I learned that some factors affects the children causes the disease including the mothers smoking behavior and drinking behavior I think their project is very useful,Anderson,0,33,0,0.79,0.21,0.4927
83,The video ARIANA ANDERSON ChatterBaby is a video revolving around an app called ChatterBaby created by UCLA professor Ariana Anderson In the video she explains what her product is and is marketing it to other people ChatterBaby is an app that analyzes the cries of infants and breaks it down allowing the parent of the guardian to know why the baby is crying Crying is a way for infants to communicate and most of the time it can be very tough to understand why they are crying Through the app Which has helped half a million people Anderson who is a mother of four children herself wants to help parents find the reason behind an infants cry and offer them proper necessary care From my perspective the app is a very useful app that can be revolutionary Anderson in the video has shared that she has an algorithm or cries in the apps database which helps to identify an infants cry through comparison and find the reason behind it The apps seem very legit because of the algorithms Anderson talks about in the video The description of the video also shares that Anderson specializes in Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences School of Medicine only making the algorithms and her findings even more credible Moreover since the app and the algorithms created by Anderson are so credible and the evidence she offers regarding the cry resulted in pain hunger and the patterns the app seems to be exceptional If used in baby monitors cribs and others like she explains in the video it can indeed be very beneficial However adding more diversity to the algorithm with the help of different infants might help make it even stronger and better at dissecting the reason behind an infants cry,Anderson,1,295,0,1,0,0
84,Dr Anderson talked about her concern about how stroke affects speech in infants and adults and her research about how she uses auditory data of people who experienced stroke then analyze the trend and find out how speech is impaired when brain stem is under stress It was really interesting because I never thought about babies would have strokes too and that will definitely affect their speech the difference is how bad the stroke affects speech in infants and how is that different from the affect to adults However she is able to use statistics to figure out the trend analyze the data and come to the conclusion to help us understand why some babies cry for a long period of time Also she gave out a lot of information that I didnt know before such as slurred speech is a common symptom of stroke,Anderson,0,145,0,1,0,0
85,Created an app for deaf people to identify which types of cries their babies were having I learned that there are different types of cries that can help identify if a baby has a health condition She also shared with us that through this app they are able to collect data for gestational diabetes and how substance abuse will increase pregnancy complicationsCriduchat syndrome Babies with the criduchat syndrome produce a highpitched cry that sounds much like a cat Because of chromosome deletion that happens with the disease the larynx develops abnormally which affects the sound of a childs cry Sound level Meter A sound level meter allows scientists to track a babys wave length of sounds Dr Anderson demonstrated what a normal healthy baby cry sounds and looks like on the sound level meter and juxtaposed that sound to the cry of a baby suffering a stroke She showed how there are several long pauses and the wave lengths are much longer,Anderson,0,162,0,0.867,0.133,0.25
86,After listening to Dr Andersons speech I have acquired new understandings on how data analytics can be applied towards different fields It is refreshing to see an app that can analyze the sound of a babys cry and how experimental data can play a big role in all these Previously I have mostly been exposed to financial data or user data and this lecture has introduced me to new aspects of data analytics and ways that data science can also contribute to biology fieldAlso Dr Andersons triggers my reflection of the concepts of big data and small data During my previous curricular projects I have mostly applied statistical techniques on largescale datasets which often requires extensive data cleaning and dimension reduction The modeling usually is the determining factor of the projects and when dealing with big data I often apply machine learning models such as logistic regression random forest boosting and etc In this course I have notice that a lot of the materials we have learned focus on experimental data small data The pure quantity of data entries is small but every number and index are meaningful Dealing with these data often involves using different types of analysis of variance which I have not previously paid much attention to I do think that Dr Andersons work is an good example of small data and I believe learning technical to deal with similar problems can help me to improve on these aspects,Anderson,1,242,0.178,0.822,0,-0.3818
87,I really enjoyed dr andersons talk One thing in particular that I found interesting was learning about the genetic disorder Cri du Chat Additionally I think that the entire characterization of different types of cries is very interesting,Anderson,0,38,0,0.77,0.23,0.5563
88,I leant that she wanted us to build models for their data collected in the software Besides I found that when making presentations it is easy to assume that your audience knows what you are talking about while in fact they could be confused,Anderson,0,44,0,1,0,0
89,I did not really know what to expect when Dr Anderson was going to speak to us and I was pleasantly surprised by her presentation and her research I found it really interesting that she is able to do her research based on something that is very relevant to not only her life but on something that affects every mother and family in the world The app ChatterBaby is a really useful and important use of statistics in order to tell what babies cries mean I really liked that she used visual verbal and auditory techniques to help us better understand the data One thing that I found very interesting was that even after her whole presentation and going through all the details of her research with us we still needed to ask on what the research question was along with the necessary outcome and predictors This was a great experience for us as statisticians and consultants because we learned that when working with a client you can have a long conversation however you will need to ask a lot of questions to get to the core of what the client is asking for Overall I am excited for our future work and the potential of working with Dr Anderson as a client and her data,Anderson,1,216,0,1,0,0
90,I really enjoyed hearing about Dr Andersons research It was great to get an insight into how statistics is used for research purposes as opposed to corporate businesses like the first talk I particularly liked how Dr Anderson is specifically trying to help babies as I find it meaningful when the skills we learn are put to use in helping others Its amazing to see something as abstract as the sound young children make being analyzed statistically and used to draw conclusions,Anderson,0,82,0,0.754,0.246,0.5563
91,Firstly it was interesting to learn about the ChatterBaby app and the usage of statistics to analyzing audio files and determining the reason behind baby cries Such applications of statistics and technology are why I decided to pursue a degree in the field in the first place I appreciated that Dr Anderson showed us examples of the differences between baby cries  for instance a baby who has had a stroke vs a baby who hasnt or a baby who is in pain or one who is not Human hearing will naturally pick up on the difference between the two but its amazing to know that machines can learn to as well And when built effectively models can understand and interpret the intricate differences between cries that we would not be able to Dr Anderson also spoke about the survey data collected by ChatterBaby Im intrigued to potentially explore the relationship between various health conditions by the mother diabetes substance abuse etc and autism development or baby behavior Overall it was quite refreshing to learn about ChatterBabys mission and the various other projects that can be done with the collected data especially when my recent perception of statistics was clouded a bit by recruiting as a field for companies to leverage for marketing or product development purposes I enjoyed learning about the good that Dr Anderson is doing,Anderson,1,228,0,0.828,0.172,0.4019
92,From Professor Andersons talk I learned a number of interesting applications of machine learning techniques in medical diagnosis and treatment For instance ChatterBaby predicts babies pain and discomfit according to sounds of their cries and another project determines the severity of strokes according to how patients talk I found such applications remarkable in the sense that they opened a new vision for medical science Instead of analyzing root causes of the health conditions researchers apply statistics to the diagnosis process with machine learning models which acquire empirical knowledge from previous clinical trials While the prediction can become highly accurate people could still doubt the mechanism of the models to make the predictions I am curious about how researchers publicize these projects to users and explain to them what is in the black box,Anderson,0,133,0,1,0,0
93,From Dr Andersons talk I learned that it is important to develop a solution or project that is applicable in reallife scenarios Also personal experiences and expert inputs are also very important in building a useful algorithm It is also important to develop a regionagnostic survey to collect data that is representative,Anderson,0,52,0,1,0,0
94,What causes gestational diabetic Will the moms habit during pregnancy change the babys behavior such as Autism In order to deliver her research clearly Dr Anderson first gave us the example videos about babies cry and people with Autism to demonstrate the importance of analyzing babys cry to detect and precure the potential diseases And one interesting thing was the frequency plot of the babys cry to visualize such a difference between healthy and unhealthy babies so that we can have a better idea of how the research operates Furthermore Dr Anderson showed us the website ChatterBaby about how they collect the data from the pregnant mom which is very detailoriented and aimful to build the model and analyze I am very impressed that the app they developed can predict what does the baby feeling by their cry,Anderson,1,138,0,1,0,0
95,The other day I learned that Professor Ariana Anderson works at the David Geffen School of Medicine and has helped develop a new application that has gone mobile as well called ChatterBaby This innovation analyzes babies cries to predict the most likely reasons they are crying The process involves comparing the babys cry with a UCLA database of about 1500 other baby cries in order to produce a probabilistic distribution of the reasons they might be crying Dr Anderson has also conducted research on trying to predict if a baby will have autism based off of the moms medical history and the babys cries This research has had some traction in the past but Dr Andersons involvement with it has seen some good development She also explained the concept of colic to us which is when a baby cries for no reason It is from this that she actually found out that the majority of colic actually represents the baby being in pain,Anderson,0,163,0,1,0,0
96,By analyzing the audio frequency of babys crying sound and the expectation of pregnant women we can judge the meaning of the sound of crying of babys,Anderson,0,27,0,1,0,0
97,Dr Ariana Anderson the statistics professor of David Geffen School of Medicine to give us some insights on her research interests and some advice for our career choice I am very interested in Arianas research interests and I am looking forward to working with her if possible Previously I did some research with a biological statistic professor I found statistics application on biological and medical problems particularly interesting and existing because I believe these fields of study are really helping human beings to stay healthy and stand against diseases Moreover I enjoyed learning about the interaction between the sound volume of babies crying and the real emotion and feelings of those babies Without enough background knowledge I would never connect this predictor to the outcome This result enlightens me that when I get into some industry I should study the industry deeply and when I understand the background knowledge deeply enough I can figure out these implicit correlations I believe these implicit relationships are the ones that will make a difference,Anderson,1,171,0,1,0,0
98,I think this is a very interesting research and I never heard of anything like this I never think of understanding baby through their crying and it is a reasonable doable and very smart thought Dr Anderson talked about the two research questions that are in interest One is the factors affecting diabetes and another one is about what behaviors mother have during pregnancy would affect the baby Through analyzing the data collected from the survey I hope we can figure out something significant and helpful The survey is also very well designed and neat which I think is very important to collect good data set,Anderson,0,106,0,0.786,0.214,0.4576
99,From today DrAndersons talk I learned that first when you have guts that something has patterns you should look into it cause that might be a new scientific finding Second as a statistical consultant you should make sure every time you finish a meeting with the client you double check on your tasks Third its normal to keep update your main algorithm,Anderson,0,62,0,1,0,0
100,Dr Anderson mainly talked about her ChatterBaby APP It use artificial intelligence and algorithm to predict about babys purpose when crying It shows me how the statistical methods can be applied in daily life especially combined with neuroscience It makes me to think about if there is any interesting things which I can use statistical knowledge to conduct indepth research Besides when we give the presentation we should clarify the sample information It is important for the audience to know Some classmates ask Dr Anderson for that and I think such information is critical to know,Anderson,0,96,0,1,0,0
101,When Dr Anderson presented to the class about her research and the ChatterBaby Infant Cry Translator App I learned how different cries indicate different feelings the implications of babies who have Colic and the factors that are believed to impact a babys development First Dr Anderson discussed how she developed an algorithm to listen to and translate a babys cry to indicate whether the baby is feeling hungry fussy or in pain She trained this algorithm to look for patterns in pitches of a babys cry to categorize it into one of those three groups I learned that there are distinct differences between a babys cry for pain vs hunger vs fussiness With pain there seems to be a lot of energy and little periods of prolonged heldout cries With the algorithm it was discovered that babies with Colic a condition when a baby doesnt stop crying are likely experiencing pain I learned that babies who experience this pain early on are hypersensitive to pain later on in life With the data that Dr Anderson has accumulated via a quasianonymous survey on the ChatterBaby App I am curious to learn more about the possible relationships between different predictors and the outcome variables of Gestational Diabetes and Substance Abuse,Anderson,0,208,0,1,0,0
102,The speech given by Dr Anderson mainly focuses on the project she is currently working on  creating and improving an app which uses artificial intelligence to let parents know when their baby is crying and the reason why their baby is crying The app she founded is called ChatterBaby which uses the algorithm employing statistical methods and machine learning used in biomedical field to study babys cry A team of scientists led by Dr Anderson developed this algorithm to identify pathological infant vocal patterns In this case we can not only know what babys need is but also detect neurodevelopmental disorders when noticing the baby has abnormal cry Incredibly this algorithm predicts babys pain with over ninety percent accuracy I think this is an innovative and practical research to apply statistics and biomedical knowledge into real world problems Although the research is initially designed for deaf parents I think almost all parents especially those first time parents would appreciate this app because it makes raising a child a lot easier Thus I am glad we will know more about this research and even participate in it through our 141 project,Anderson,1,191,0,1,0,0
103,Dr Andersons talk was one of the most applicable talks we have had so far into the quarter It was extremely insightful to hear her detailed talk about her app which detects the sounds of babies crying and then tries to identify what kind of cry it is This way one can diagnose if the baby is having a stroke if it is healthy or if it was born when the mother had gestational diabetes I liked how she made us who could be future app developers and data scientists understand the different problems associated with creating a holistic application by telling us of the issues that rose because her team collected data only from English speaking countries but aimed to create a Spanish feature She also explained how her app had a social impact focus as it would allow deaf mothers to analyze the health of their babies without having to hire specialized help I think Dr Andersons talk was a good way to learn how we can apply our statistical knowledge and skill set to create practical products which impact a large number of lives,Anderson,1,187,0,1,0,0
104,Dr Anderson created an application named Chatter Baby which is an infant cry translator She used EEG on babies to capture their brains electrical activity Her hypothesis is babies with brain damageautismetc have different cries from other babies Essentially the Chatter Baby application is a smartphone application that has an algorithm to let parents predict whether or not the baby is in pain Furthermore she talked about Stats 141SLs project details The project will involve predictive modelling to predict two things  firstly what predictors can affect your chances of gestational diabetes secondly do babies who have mothers who went through substance abuse during the pregnancy present autisticlike behavior When filling out survey preferences for Stats 141SLs final project I did not fill out medical research because I thought that my interests did not include medical research However after listening to Dr Andersons talk I became very intrigued by her research In my opinion her research will be impactful towards everyone especially the community of mothers and their babies,Anderson,1,169,0,0.846,0.154,0.25
105,The talk with Dr Ariana Anderson was very compelling to me and I liked how she described the aspects of her app ChatterBaby and the process of how it came to be I thought it was interesting how she said that the app could measure babies up to two years of age But the most intriguing aspect of her talk was the process of going through the different baby cries I didnt realize how much of a difference there would be in the cries of a baby and it was a little disheartening to learn that the babies with colic are in pain However the process of discovering that through the use of the algorithm was very interesting Due to the effectiveness of the algorithm that ChatterBaby has developed maybe there can be new solutions for babies that have colic I think that it is very useful that the app has a place for mothers to take surveys so the app can record information about the mothers which could be used in helpful preventative measures,Anderson,1,175,0,1,0,0
106,Some of the things I learned from Dr Andersons talk is that she works with the David Geffen School of Medicine She developed the Chatterbaby app which analyzes a babys cries and predicts the most probable reason for their crying It compares the babys cries with UCLAs database consisting of 1500 different babies cries When the app analyzed babies crying from colic the apps algorithm predicted that their cries were cries of pain which suggests that babies with colic are actually in pain This could help parents take care of their babies better and attend to their needs in a faster manner I think this is very interesting because it demonstrates the wide variety of applications for data science,Anderson,0,119,0,1,0,0
107,The main thing I learned from Dr Andersons talk was the fact that babys cry can actually be translated into a distinct need Until the day I heard about Dr Andersons talk I had no idea that babys cry could hold a variety kinds of meanings According to Dr Anderson babys vocal pattern can be used for analysis and allow us to create an algorithm Another thing I learned and was interested in was the fact that the algorithm created from babys vocal pattern can also be used for babies with illness This algorithm can allow us to distinguish between the ill babies and healthy babies I never thought that statistical analysis can be used as a form of diagnosis Just like what Dr Anderson said some babies get illnesses such as autism spectrum disorder Since babies cannot talk or do any kind of communication I believe this kind of disorder is very critical to any babies The only thing babies can do is cry and this is the reason why I believe the algorithm used in ChatterBaby is an extremely important resource for the medical system Overall until I heard about Dr Andersons talk I honestly thought that statistical analysis I will be doing after the graduation could be very boring and maybe not something I anticipated so much till now However after hearing her talk I realized that statistical analysis can basically be connected to just about anything in our lives I personally love any kind of activities that are helpful for other people and I thought that I might also be able to use statistical analysis and find something similar to ChatterBaby,Anderson,1,275,0,1,0,0
108,In Wednesdays lecture Dr Anderson the founder of the Chatterbaby project uses artifiicla intelligence to predict babys status when baby is crying Dr Anderson firstly collected audio records from painful cries when babies were receiving vaccines and analyzed the frequency and tone of the crying She classified the status of crying into fussy hungry and pain When a new audio recording comes in the algorithm would match the recording with the database and uses statistic echnique to predict the babys status This statistics application is extremely helpful for parents because it is really hard to identify a baybs need when crying and solve deaf parents huge problems,Anderson,0,107,0,1,0,0
109,I should pay more attention to whats going on in our lives to find interesting research topics When presenting to others it will be very useful to reiterate the research question and predictors at the end so that the audience will have a clearer idea about the direction the project is going Binary outcomes are indeed very important in scientific research,Anderson,0,61,0.097,0.903,0,-0.1027
110,First and foremost I think that her research is a creative way to aid in a very important problem I think that it is amazing that they have the questionnaire available in many different languages because it helps include people which are normally marginalized by conventional health programs However I did notice that all the data came from the United States With regards to the riskscore of autism would there need to be different systems of attributing these scores to account for cultural difference in behavior For example the expected level of eye contact from a child may change between countries due to cultural factors,Anderson,0,105,0,1,0,0
111,Cat cry of the baby can predict the stroke condition on infants Current sound patterns can sort out the situations when infants feel pain 2 Besides providing side informations it is important to express the research questions explicitly we want to investigate on factors that might cause stationary diabetes for women during pregnancy such as substance abuse family history and generic impacts 3 The data we are using are mostly selfreported survey data that might lead to bias The data base is around 2000 which is not an enormous data base As a result it is essential to explore potential data sources and select robust columns for feature engineering,Anderson,1,109,0.181,0.819,0,-0.4767
112,Dr Andersons presentation today taught me that it is very essential to be able to obtain the true question a consultant wants from given data They may present a question to you but it is your job to decode the actual meaning behind what they are really wanting to ask This process may take multiple meetings to finalize Besides learning about consulting I also learned that although everyones speech is unique theyre are common patterns that can be useful for prediction,Anderson,0,81,0,1,0,0

114,Something that Dr Andersons talk made clear to me about the field of statistical consulting is the importance of clarification with the client It was really easy for us to get lost in the details since the client while presenting their ideaproduct may not be cognizant of the information we need and dont need for our analysis Getting clarity on the outcome and predictor variables allows us to narrow our focus on the dataset which may contain variables extraneous to our analysis Another thing that was interesting is the application of statistical knowledge to healthcare which is something Im interested in working for the future Her presentation made it clear to me how interdisciplinary the field of statistics is and how I can combine my statistical skills with my passion for public health in the workplace,Anderson,1,136,0,0.822,0.178,0.3818
115,Dr Ariana Anderson from David Geffen School of Medicine through Skype It was an inspiring and educational lecture that Dr Anderson introduced us about a lot of datadriven applications in medical areas The first interesting knowledge I got from Dr Anderson was the importance of the way of thinking I was surprised at the result of her study on baby crying I never thought about the fusion of physics knowledge on sound and statistical data analysis Her success in finding out the correlation between the sound volume of baby crying and babies mood is clearly a good example of thinking out of the box I believe there are a lot of opportunities in the real world that we can use our statistical knowledge of different industries With the proper use of the correct analyzing method there should be a lot of chances to bring revolutions to those areas The second inspiring thing Dr Anderson shared was her general passion and confidence in statistics of medical school I was not familiar with the application of statistics in medical areas Ariana presented her study passionately and confidently and made me really think about the lack of knowledge of myself toward this area I think it might be helpful for me before when I make a decision for my career choice to really explore different industries and find out where my destination really should be,Anderson,1,232,0,1,0,0
116,I have learned some interesting facts including that from a childs crying we can extrapolate information about the mothers health Also the childs emotional state can also be determined from the babys cry I have also learned how difficult it is to collect data and do research and what obstacles are involved,Anderson,0,52,0,0.787,0.213,0.4019
117,I am really impressed by Dr Andersons research We can see how statistics can be applied to our lives and make them easier The innovation is surprising because it solves the problem that many moms might be disturbed at and also it is the thing that people seldom consider This experience inspires and allows me to know that we are able to improve the world via our knowledge,Anderson,0,68,0,0.764,0.236,0.5256
118,Babies cry differently with different vocal patterns when they are in pain hungry or just irritated It is possible for babies to have stroke Stroke affects speech abilities Dr Anderson has created a free app that can help mothers around the world identify why their babies are crying There is also a survey being distributed and she has the question of whether diabetes developed during pregnancy has an effect on baby health,Anderson,0,72,0.22,0.78,0,-0.4767
119,In the speech I learned about the program called chatterbaby It gives people the idea why babies are crying In the program it collected a large number of data Statistical ways are also applied which show us how helpful and how effective statistics are It is related to so many aspects of our daily life and can come up with a helpful method,Anderson,0,63,0,1,0,0
120,Collect data for the statistics experiment is sort of difficult and we should pay enough effort for that Statistics is not all about financial and biomedical and it appears in many aspects of our life The statistics can be very interesting and applicable We can conduct research on a simple phenomenon and find the hidden relationship Statistics is not a subject that you can spend all time in class and we should have a board perspective on statistics,Anderson,0,78,0,1,0,0
121,With so much of the data in this class for the project coming from the medical field it was really interesting to see an application of stats applied to something related to the medical field It is nice to learn about the diverse ways statistics can be used in the world It was also just fascinating to hear about the app Dr Anderson developed Chatterbaby sounds like something out of a movie or out of the future I also had absolutely no idea that certain cry patterns could indicate a higher potential for autism,Anderson,0,94,0,1,0,0
122,There were 2 main things I learned from Dr Andersons talk Medical research is heavily dependent on accurate selfreporting Dr Anderson mentioned that in the development of the ChatterBaby app the babies cries were rated as fussy hungry or painrelated by a panel of mothers including the actual mother If the panel could not reach a consensus that particular cry would go unclassified hence if the actual mothers misclassified their own babies cries and disagreed with the other members of the panel then that would result in a loss of valuable data This phenomenon is seen also in countless patients who dont want to believe that they are sick or in need of medical attention and who subsequently fail to report possibly critical symptomsStandard statistical procedures are still invaluable in research today At times it has been easy for me to wonder why everyone hasnt switched to more powerful machine learning methods yet since they are largely nonparametric and seemed to have attained excellent predictive results However I was reminded by Dr Anderson that researchers dont just want to know predictionsthey want to understand what factors are actually important and for that even the very traditional regression approaches can be especially insightful For instance when she referenced the data about gestational diabetes it would be much more difficult to interpret the relationship between predictors and the outcome with a machine learning model than with a simple logistic regression model only the latter has directly interpretable coefficients in the form of odds ratios,Anderson,1,252,0,1,0,0
123,I thought Dr Andersons work was a very interesting application of statistics Were always told about the importance of statistics in the medical field but Dr Anderson made it a much more tangible thing by explaining how she used her statistics trainingbackground in a medical settingDr Andersons proposed project consisted of finding factors that caused gestational diabetes and seeing if substance use during pregnancy mapped to changes in behavior Both of these research areas seem very niche and potentially interesting She also seemed rather passionate about her project which to me emphasized the importance of finding an application of statistics that is important to me,Anderson,1,105,0,1,0,0
124,In Dr Andersons talk about ChatterBaby Infant Cry Translator I learned that a babys cry will differ depending on the reason the baby is crying such as the difference between pain being fussy and being hungry It was interesting to learn about Cri du Chat syndrome as babies with this syndrome can have a distinctive cry that sounds like a kittens cry I also learned that babies with colic can actually be in pain or grow up to be more likely to have issues such as migraines and food allergies I find that ChatterBaby is an extremely interesting and useful tool that mothers can use to better care for their babies Dr Anderson also made a good point about while most other research studies can only sample from within a certain radius from the lab since ChatterBaby collects data from its users it is able to have a wealth of varied data to work with,Anderson,1,155,0,1,0,0
125,Dr Anderson talked about using machine learning to analyze the frequency and tone of baby crying to identify if the baby is fussy hungry or in pain Dr Anderson also talked about she was interested in if a mothers mental health diabetes hemophilia social status would affect the baby Dr Anderson is also a mother of four and so I guessed she came up this idea to solve the problem when a mother does not understand why the baby is crying I learned that entrepreneurial idea could come from daily life but the action is important,Anderson,1,96,0,1,0,0
126,From Dr Andersons lecture today we obtained a good understanding of the project that we will be working on during the second half of the course Dr Anderson stated the statistical problems that we should focus on 1 to classify if the person has stationary diabetes binary outcome and 2 to create a numeric outcome variable representing the risk of having altruism based on certain factors We also obtained the background information of this project as well as the process of collecting the dataset From these background information I had a better knowledge of how valuable the project we will be doing as well as where does each of the predictor variables come from and how do they relate to the outcome variable that we will concentrate on predicting This process of introducing the topic of the project via livestream reminded me of the event UCLA DataFest where the dataset and the prompt are revealed by the people who collected the data and introduced by who are experts in the related fields Another thing that I found important is to grasp the statistical questions that we need to solve Without correctly understanding what the problems are we cannot solve the problem in the appropriate way and truly help the clients,Anderson,1,210,0,1,0,0
127,It is interesting how Dr Anderson got the idea of conducting research on baby cries and how she uses the data to create an algorithm that can interpret baby cries I used to think baby cries were similar and it never appears to me that we can actually understand the meaning of them by simply recording them into an app It is also new to me that babies with certain diseases make different cries than others and Chatterbaby can be very helpful in discovering these potential diseases in time The Chatterbaby algorithm is able to analyze the baby cries and compare them with its database and it is also fascinating that how the app is improving itself while providing services to its users The baby cries that parents record using this app are not only examined but also documented for future use Dr Anderson and her team are able to use these data to perfect the algorithm or conduct further research,Anderson,1,161,0,0.828,0.172,0.4019
128,One of the projects Dr Andersons talked about in class was her research on the classification of baby cries Dr Andersons group developed an algorithm that would classify the baby cries into different categories From her slide it is easy to see that the sound pattern of the cry induced by different reasons is drastically different Thus machine learning programs could grasp these differences in sound patterns and make accurate predictions of what babies actually mean I am really interested in Dr Andersons project on classification of baby cries The sound could be regarded as form of sequential data In fact sound files in a computer system can be regarded as a list of values arranged according to their timestamp I dont know what kinds of model Dr Andersons group is using to develop the app that classifies baby cries and it is likely that they had already been using the optimal solution However I think a timeseries model would be a good choice for doing classifications like baby cries,Anderson,1,170,0,1,0,0
129,In dr andersons talk we learned about a research project that hshe has been working on that is to perform algorithm analysis on babys crying to detect different kind of crying There were several questions about the sample of her study and the way of collecting the sample from students and professors Through those interactions I realized that it is very important to include the sample information when delivering a project as the sample is one of the most essential elements of a research Therefore in the future when I do my own presentation I would include that information as part of the background knowledge to make sure my audience get the whole picture,Anderson,1,114,0,1,0,0
130,It is important to keep passionate for your study or your research It takes a long time for a research to start from scratch to a point where everything is on the right track and insights are found so researchers should be patient and remain rigorous Statistical analysis plays a critical role in scientific research since all data collected from survey or report requires detailed analysis so that conclusions or insights can be made,Anderson,0,74,0,0.698,0.302,0.6369
131,Firstly I learned that binary classification is an important concept to learn since its plays an important role in her project Secondly I learned that we need to take careful observation of our lives just like how she observed different infant cries can have different meanings Thirdly I learned to think about need of disadvantaged people As a mother Dr Anderson thinks about needs of deaf parents and developed ChatterBaby for them to make their lives easier which is what I should learn,Anderson,1,83,0,1,0,0
132,She talks about the project she is working on which is quite interesting Lot of data are sampled from families all over the world Through these data they were able to train a model that is able to recognize whether the baby is in pain or just gets hungry etc I think this app is very useful for mothers It allows them to take better care of their children We can see that she has a rich background knowledge towards the project I think it is very important to know your data Therefore we should always learn more about the subject related to your project,Anderson,1,105,0,1,0,0
133,New parents are always stressful when baby cry so it is useful to have an app which can translate babys cry Moreover it is useful for hearing loss parents With this large data of infant cries Dr Anderson is able to distinguish the cries of babies who have stroke analyze how stroke affect speech and identify cries between normal children and children who develop autism This is a very unique point to look at babys healthy and with larger database we can know more about what babys cry indicate,Anderson,1,89,0.216,0.784,0,-0.5106
134,We had a perfect guest speaking last week Through the speaking We learned concepts and useful things We can get some important information about kids mothers health statues such as smoking behavior,Anderson,0,32,0,0.764,0.236,0.5719
135,From the speech of DrAnderson gave us I learned a lot about both professional career knowledge and soft skills For example her presentation is professional with lots of statistics materials provided during her speech She did provide a lot of graphs produced by R STUDIO to support her ideas and thinking Moreover her research field is interesting She provided that she used statistics method and skills to connected babys crying and statistics data I can tell that all the audience attracted by her interesting topics She brought me to another fantasy field Also she used lots of professional statistics terminology during her presentation such as pvalues r square etc For soft skill part she also did very good She always try to connect with students and answer the questions from the audience Moreover she always smiles and speak slowly to make sure that everyone enjoy this presentation,Anderson,1,147,0,1,0,0
136,Dr Anderson talked about her recent researchChatterbaby which is a database that collects babys sounds in different status and compare ones baby to the algorithm to predict why the baby is crying The algorithm use machine learning to determine which acoustic is feature of the status I think this research is useful because babies cannot express themselves by language crying is their special language that can connect parents and babies,Anderson,1,70,0,1,0,0
137,Dr Andersons project is very inspiring for me I think it is a very interesting idea to initiate a project based on personal experiences Moreover I learnt that as statistical consultants we should define our terms clearly during presentations,Anderson,0,39,0,0.808,0.192,0.4754
138,Dr Andersons work on the chatter baby project inspired me a lot It gave me a clue about what data analyst can do Instead of only in banking or other things data analysis can be used in almost every aspect in everyday life 2 Visualization is quite important in data analysis to present to the customers,Anderson,0,56,0,1,0,0
139,From Dr Andersons talk on Wednesday I had a chance to learn a very amazing application called ChatterBaby which effectively predicts whether and why a baby is crying and the accuracy is about 90 The user only needs to fill out some personal information and their babys information in order to get started When their baby is crying users just need to use this application to record their babys cry for five seconds and the application would analyzes it automatically then predicts the reasons that why baby is crying whether the baby is fussy hungry pain or other reasons There are two groups in our class will be assigned to work on a project related to this amazing application and there are two questions that Dr Anderson want these two groups to answer The first question is that what factors are related to gestational diabetes where gestational diabetes is a categorical variable with two levels And the second question is that what substances such as alcohol pregnant women use during pregnancy would affect their behavior where the outcome is the risk score for autism which is a numerical variable Since I am not really familiar with anything related to medicine I feel like its not a good project for me but I am looking forward to seeing how these two groups will deal with this interesting project,Anderson,1,227,0,1,0,0
140,In the talk by Dr Anderson on her development of Chatterbaby that uses both her statistical knowledge and experience as a mother to develop the application An important takeaway from the talk is the ability by Dr Anderson to be keen enough to notice the similarities and discrepancies in the crying patterns of her four children It is based on this knowledge that the developer created an algorithm that matches the recorded cry of the baby and deciphers the needs of the baby to fit a certain prediction In the application the cry signatures are stored in form of acoustic features in the database According to use of these acoustic features used the algorithm is well able to help parents in understanding their babies in ages where talking is not an option For example the smart application can show when a bay is in pain or hungry like the irritability caused by pain in a colic cry pattern Dr Anderson does not stop at only identification of the reason behind the cry she goes on to try and elaborate how the reasons behind the cry can be sorted out That is a passive pain management device can track and monitor infant pain overtime Some of the pain management patterns that are observed include medication and feeding According to the speaker this application is vital in ensuring that previous errors in pain management are not repeated With the application gaining traction in the media the development of the application has been further enabled through collection of more baby cries Dr Anderson believes that with licensing and partnership with other related partners that are involved in production of baby products the Infant Cry Translator can be more successful,Anderson,1,286,0,1,0,0
141,It was so nice to have Dr Anderson as our guest speaker talking about her project and her dataset This is the first time I heard about how a data was collected and the purpose of the dataset For most of my statistical projects I only got codebooks for the dataset so I dont really know how and why the dataset is collected Dr Andersons research is about babies crying Through recording babies crying and based on the data it is helpful to get a sense of why a baby cry One of the reasons why a baby cries could be stroke Therefore the research is helpful to know what is going on with a baby when heshe cries and save hisher life,Anderson,1,123,0,0.806,0.194,0.5598
142,Dr Anderson talked about how babys crying can tell the healthy condition of a baby Babies with stroke would cry without stops for a bit of time and then back to normal I was very surprised how statistical methods can be used in diagnosis,Anderson,0,44,0.193,0.807,0,-0.4767
143,Dr Andersons talk is very informative She introduces us to her project of using machine learning models to distinguish the reason for babies crying I think it is very good that when she setting up the experiments she let three people who are very familiar with taking care of babies to distinguish the purpose of babies cry My concern is whether three people is enough and whether their diagnoses are reliable Since this decision could be very subjective is there any way to improve the accuracy of the identification,Anderson,1,89,0,0.741,0.259,0.6369
144,Dr Andersons talk provided me a lot of information to how smoking moms influence their childrens behavior and health I would like to lean more and explore more about this topic in the future This speak enriched my understanding in the field and inspired me a lot,Anderson,0,47,0,1,0,0

146,"I have learned a lot from the advice Dr Kricorian gave on statistical consulting Below are three points that resonated with me Be patient You Cant Produce a Baby in One Month by Getting Nine Women Pregnant This principle is so true but also easy to forget People come from different backgrounds and everyone needs time to learn when they encounter things the first time We need to observe the natural learning and product cycle and be patient towards the end goal Be open minded When we believe in an idea we should also think about the opposite Playing the devils advocate is a good practice to help use see things from a different perspective and may also deepen our understanding about a problem Also when you feel you are the most intelligent person in the room then you should change your room The time when you feel you dont know things is when you grow the most Build relationships Its not what you know Its who you know Treat every meeting as an interview because you will never know where other people will end up Soft skills are important Technical skills get you into the room while soft skills get you the seat 
 
 
 Dr Kricorians talk was very insightful What stood out for me was to put yourself in a position to not only find success but happiness and how these things are a function of the work you put in Helping others being in a room where you can learn from others and climbing your way up to where you want to be but also understanding that things change and you might not want to be there forever and that thats okay",Kricorian,1,287,0,1,0,0

 During stats 141 lecture I enjoyed DrKiocians speech because she gave me clear ideas about what kind of duties and responsibilities a statistical analyst have to the customer One thing I still remember from her speech is how to make a better question based on customers needs Sometimes the customers doesnt even know what question they should ask based on data from the market As a statistical analyst we should be very patient to first listen customers questions and then use statistics to help them make better questions for specific business decisions or strategies I think this is quite important and interesting things to do in the position of analyzing market situations",Kricorian,1,188,0,1,0,0

 skills cover abilities that I have not been introduced to yet When she was asked to perform
 some park forecasts for Disney although she did not have the skills yet her curiosity and
 attitude did not prevent her from learning the techniques needed for attendance forecasting
 Another interesting topic was mentioned by Professor Esfandiari about anxiety As someone
 that has been anxious for a majority of life I have also learned to accept how anxiety is not
 always a negative aspect of my personality and life Anxiety can also help procure progress
 and make sure that I do not lose track of my goals or tasks at hand Esfandiari and Kricorians
 conversation has helped me gain more perspective and insight towards the anxieties that I have
 dealt with
 
 Lastly I agree with what Dr Kricorian said about not rushing to give an answer and instead wait
 for the complete question or to help find the question when consulting I often get too ahead of
 myself when approaching tasks and need to spend more time thinking and formulating the
 actual problem to solve Not only does the use of inquisitive questions better define the answer
 but also improves ones own social skillsemotional intelligence By sitting with the client and
 listening before responding shows a great level of maturity and allows the client to feel heard

 focal point of our lives She said If you feel like youre the smartest person in the room

 because most people strive to be the best in what they do but being the best may stunt
 your growth as a learner I suppose that the most important thing is your perspective and
 willingness to grow as a person Instead of striving to reach an end goal its important to
 look at the immediate steps ahead of you and think about how you can grow more each
 step of the way She also talked about how growth involves putting oneself in
 uncomfortable and challenging situations Although it might be tempting to choose a job

 learned the importance of first understanding a clients question
 before working to find the answer This concept was reiterated in the ethical readings for this

 I learned that sometimes when taking a stance you should try to consider the opposite to get a holistic view of the problems This allows you the consider more options
 
 I also learned that you should not limit yourself with boundaries If you do that you will be stuck But if you remove the boundaries you are limitless

 Overall I really enjoyed Dr Kricorians talk and I found the information refreshing and very valuable and I was able to connect with the topics she spoke about so I will be able to remember them in the future
 
 I learned that people tend to have biases in decision making Therefore when we brainstorm about solutions to the problems it helps to have rational views and not trust our intuitions too much As statistical consultants we are responsible for giving objective recommendation and abide by best practices and ethical standards which requires us to always think twice when giving professional advice
 I learned that in statistical consulting it is very important to examine the assumptions that we have on a current question before we start to think about the solution of a problem The possible falseness of the assumption can change the possible solutions dramatically I also learned that when helping clients it is very important to think from their perspectives and identify their true problems that they want to handle in order to come up with solutions that address their concerns Finally I learned that sometimes it might be tempting to use advanced techniques and methods such as machine learning to solve a problem but sometimes the question only needs to be answered with simple statistical methods",Kricorian,1,348,0,1,0,0

 approach that you may not have had much practice applying in class that is okay

 asking for Oftentimes they dont and you need to extract this out of them Also be open

166,"I learned a lot from todays speaker and the three things that she talked about that were most inspiring for me were about opening our mind learning and listening to the question before answering and trying to do things that are beneficial to surrounding without asking for immediate payback
 
 I have always been wondering how I can be a more openminded person I thought this is something that people are born with and there is not really an easy way that you can make someone or yourself to be more openminded because it is hard to change ones personality or decision I always thought I probably need a life change event so that I can change the way I think of the world completely But after todays speech I realized that I have been thinking about this question way too complicated than it should be Being an openminded person actually starts from tiny things like trying out some new food or pick another route to go home These small things can change ones mind gradually
 
 The second thing I learned from the speech is that we always want to answer the questions we meet immediately by fitting it to our toolbox because we are trained to do so However when getting into reallife situations problems can be complicated and there is no way that we always see a problem that we have solved before and know how to solve them right the way Therefore listen to the question carefully and understand them completely before starting solving them would be the most effective way of solving problems
 
 The last thing I learned is to try to benefit the surrounding without asking for immediate payback I feel like I have been overthinking about what I can get from doing one thing but not enough for what effect I can make about the surrounding It is actually crucial and satisfying to get to create something beneficial to the world and sometimes you do get more opportunities by helping out and doing good things",Kricorian,1,343,0,1,0,0

 not necessary to use all the tools or the most complex tools to solve a problem In consulting she
 emphasized it is important to remember the scope of the project in order to apply the methods that
 will come up with a solution that meets the needs of the client

 The last lesson that heavily affected me was the part where she talked about preparing questions before we ask those questions When I heard this part of her lecture I immediately thought about the research questions I had in the past statistics classes After thinking for awhile I realized that I never cared too much about research questions In a research project the part I mostly cared about was always the data analysis and I rarely cared about questions such as why I chose this research topic why I chose this model why I chose to produce certain outcome and so on

 When doing the consulting jobs the question is more important than the answer and we should spent most our time considering the questions we ask When the question is right the answer is easy to figure out
 We should learn to be patience and calm down when necessary We should take the information and not let the emotion control us
 We should open our mind and consider our opposite

187,Dr Kricorians presentation was full of good advice I found it interesting how much more important personablesoft skills are in the workplace than being the most technically skilled worker I also found it helpful to hear advice on how to use anxiety and feelings of stupidity to improve yourself cause that is when youre being challenged I also thought it was most helpful to hear that one should look for a job where youre actually happy over the best job so you can be your best,Kricorian,0,86,0.228,0.611,0.161,-0.296
188,"The map is not the territory This was her final point and although its something I had heard before I didnt fully think through how important it is to distinguish the model from reality Before I had often fallen into the trap of focusing solely on the model and how to improve it instead of taking a step back and remembering what Im trying to predict in the first place
 Dont limit yourself Dr Kricorian talked at length about how graduate school can narrow your mind to a certain extent and how you need to keep yourself open to all sorts of new ideas This was particularly helpful for me to consider since I am thinking about graduate school
 Consider the opposite This is something I didnt think about too deeply before since I usually just try to get my work done However Dr Kricorians words have encouraged me to be more careful in what conclusions I reach and to not get stuck in the details either",Kricorian,1,167,0,1,0,0
189,"From Dr Kricorians talk I was reminded of the importance of professionalism making
 connections and listening to your anxieties Dr Kricorians points about working with others and staying professional reminded me about the importance of it I think because for students professionalism is not as important as it is in industry I often forget about it But its a good idea to practice that now while working in teams In terms of making connections Dr Kricorian reminded me that being willing to help people without immediate gratification can be a very good way of making connections This will remind me to help others when I can and to be willing to learn new things while doing so One of the most important pieces of advice I got from Dr Kricorians talk was that I should listen to my anxieties and take them as possible signs that a

 relationships with other people and working well with them as a team This was an interesting
 point because I always think about the importance of growing my technical skills but
 interpersonal skills are just as important I also appreciated how Dr Kricorian talked about
 making sure that you understand the clients question well before jumping in Initially
 understanding the clients question sounds simple but now I know that we need to question our own assumptions about the question and make sure we fully understand it If we dont do this we could waste time or even end up doing a correct analysis that does not actually answer the clients question Finally I liked Dr Kricorians advice about what to do when a client is not
 convinced by your analysis While ones first reaction might be to be defensive a better approach is to change the clients perspective and beliefs about the problem through questioning to help them understand your approach",Kricorian,1,173,0,1,0,0

 consultant it is important for us to be a good team player a good listener as well as to nurture our soft skills We need to be a good team player so that we know how to combine peoples talents in solving challenges We need to be a good listener so that when clients come we know how to correctly understand their questions and come up with the right solutions We need to nurture many different soft skills such as communication and public speaking skills as these skills are often more frequently used in the workplace than knowledge from books As Dr Kricorian said hard skills are extremely important but we also need to pay attention to strengthening the soft ones as we will be interacting with people when we go to the workplace",Kricorian,1,150,0,1,0,0

 be confident for the rest of our future career Also we need to do our best to help others The

201,"Here are the three strategies I learned from Dr Kricorians talk First of all always know about the question and always spend time on analyzing the question before answering it It will save much time Secondly the study mode during the graduate and phd program is quite different from that during undergraduate Students are required to learn from the teacher during the undergraduate program However during the graduate or phd program students are required to learn by themselves Finally I have learned that we should be patient about things even though it is in emergency
 What did I learn from Dr kricorian s talk 
 I  Understand the meaning of question first instead of eagering to solve the problem  Try to use my own words to ask clients if thats what they want because sometimes clients may sent me the wrong message 
 2 Feel confident about myself I need to feel confident and dare to try new things when I get chances to learn something I am not familiar with  And its
 never too late to learn

203,I learned that patience is very essential in statistical consulting Sometimes since we had done so much in learning statistics it is very likely to jump to conclusion However its not always true that our instinct is giving the right answer We should be patient and think out of box Sometimes we also need to think of the opposite Its a common tendency that people think only from their standpoint In order to get better view of the situation and be prepared for all risk we should consider the perspective of the opponent,Kricorian,1,93,0,1,0,0
204,The talk from Dr Kricorian gives me lots of inspiration I learned that we should try answer complex questions with simple answers From the goldfish example I learned that sometimes we need to question the basic assumptions The watermelon example encouraged me to think out of the box In addition it is very important to know our own biases so we will know what errors we may make in work,Kricorian,1,70,0,1,0,0
